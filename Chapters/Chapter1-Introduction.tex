\section{Pretext}

AUVIC, is a team of students whose objective is to design, build, and compete an AUV. The team evolves as the students at the university join, enter Co-ops, and graduate. The team provides students with opportunity for hands on experience in submarine design, and work on complex autonomous systems.
Talk about team. Teams history. Role in team. Different sub-teams. Communication and meeting between sub-teams and members.

\section{Report Contents}

This report documents the migration from an old statically programmed control system with more responsibility than needed to a dynamic control system and two other systems taking over the excess responsibility. Starting off with explaining and understanding the problem domain from the perspective of the control system. The report then ventures into the domain of software reengineering where three different processes are described that occur. Those processes being: reverse engineering, restructuring, and forward engineering. The report then concludes with an analysis of the failures and successes of the produced system. All previous followed by the conclusion which expands on what was learned from the entire process.
