\section{Pretext}

AUVIC, is a team of students whose objective is to design, build, and compete an
\gls{AUV}.
The team evolves as the students at the university join, enter
Co-ops, and graduate.
The team provides students with opportunity for hands on experience in submarine
design, and work on complex autonomous systems.


Talk about team. Teams history. Role in team. Different sub-teams. Communication and meeting between sub-teams and members.

\section{Report Contents}

This report documents the migration from an old static control system with
responsibility that should be separated into other systems, to a dynamic control
system and two other systems taking over the excess responsibility.
Starting off with explaining and understanding the problem domain from the
perspective of the control system.
The report then ventures into the domain of software re-engineering where three
different processes inform the software redesign.
The processes mentioned previously being: reverse engineering, restructuring,
and forward engineering.

After the design and implementation the report concludes with reflection on the
software system produced from the redesign. This goes over strengths,
weaknesses, and failures of the redesign.
This is done in two parts, a conclusion which talks about the results of the
system featured at competition, which will show the strength of the system
running with all components simultaneously. This will also test our software
configuration quality, as this will require that our configurations are written
correctly.
the report then concludes the reflection with a detailed analysis of what failed
and succeeded. And suggestions of how to fix the failure that was outlined.
